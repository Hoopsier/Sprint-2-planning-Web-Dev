- Implemented responsive layout. 
- Contributed to the presentation slides 
- Actively participated in team discussions and completed tasks on time.
- Self Rating (9/10): I gave my best effort during this sprint and improved my skills, 
  but I can still improve component reusability and accessibility.

### Dornaraj (Developer + product owner now):

- I also did a small amount of Figma design
- I was active in the frontend development of the project.

### Noel (UI designer + Developer):
- I focused mainly on frontend development, especially the restaurant list UI and overall page structure.
- I helped translate parts of the Figma prototype into real React components and adjusted details that only appear once you start coding.
- I worked on improving responsiveness and small UI consistency fixes (spacing, layout, and component alignment).
- I contributed ideas about how the restaurant flow should work (registration logic, pricing, delivery distance), using platforms like Wolt/Uber Eats as references for reasoning.
- I actively joined team discussions and tried to keep my tasks moving forward with regular commits.
- Self Rating (9/10): I delivered my assigned frontend work and learned a lot, but I can improve by communicating earlier when I’m blocked and by planning my tasks more tightly to avoid last-minute polishing.
