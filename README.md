# Sprint 2 Goal
By the end of Sprint 2, the team will deliver a working front-end and back-end structure aligned with the Sprint 1 prototype, including mock data, and initial AI-related endpoints.

## Sprint 2 Backlog Creation

### Extracting Sprint 2 Backlog

As the Product Owner, I selected the Sprint 2 Backlog directly from the Product Backlog.  
Only items that contribute to the Sprint 2 goal were included.

Sprint 2 focuses on:
- A working front-end and back-end structure
- Initial integration between frontend and backend
- Use of mock data
- Initial AI-related endpoints (basic or placeholder)

Therefore, Sprint 2 backlog items cover:
- Front-end implementation
- Back-end implementation (including AI-related endpoints)

### 5.2 Sprint 2 User Stories and Story Points

All Sprint 2 backlog items are written as user stories where applicable and estimated using story points.  
Estimation was done collaboratively by the team using the scale:

**Story Points Scale:** 1, 2, 3, 5, 8  
Story points represent relative effort and complexity, not hours.

Each backlog item includes:
- A user story or short description
- Assigned story points
- Responsible team member(s)
