# How we will use branches
-- main: will not be updated until last change
-- development: will have working code, (used to see how features work together)
-- feature: ONE USER PER BRANCH. say you're making a header. you name the branch (context)-header or header if there is no context.
-- before making a **pull request** to development, to git pull --rebase origin development and test your task again.
